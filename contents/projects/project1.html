          "Bruster" is an exploration level built in Unreal Engine 5.  
          So basically Bruster is a part of the story in elemental nexus. Freya have
          to Go to this place to obtain the - The Air Element
          which is the second element she have to obtain. So I first made a basic layout and jumped into blender to do blocking. Then I jumped into Unreal to finally make the Environment.

    <div class="project-description">
        
        This Level have two portions. The upper portion i.e village and the second portion that is the cave which will be unlocked after getting all three parts of the Key. <br><br>
        Then I jumped back into Blender to do placements of the enemies.

    <div class="project-description">
        
        This is my second 3D layout. Just for placing Enemies, Chests and Keys. The First one was not having any details about the placing of things. 
        So this part was done after making the Environment. <br>
        Maybe this happened because it's open world ..? But ya now I have final placements.

<div class="project-description">
    
    The cave part will mainly include puzzles and traps. most of the traps will work on air related things like platform going up and down whith air pressured vents, <br>
    Air activated buttons, Toxic Air, and finally the guardian of Air Element. After defeating and taking the element, the player will get powers which he have to use to get out of cave.

    And don't ask me why, but I did this final top-down Layout of level after doing environment design. 
    Meanwhile I was building the Level and Platesting it again and again for Placements of Everything.<br><br>
