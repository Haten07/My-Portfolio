        This is a Car. A car that dont have any interior cuz I made it vertex by vertex in Maya. I know its easy for many of 3D artists but I am not one. I just get bored for working on a single thing with no creativity.

          Ya I rigged it in Blender using a Unreal plugin. After which I was able to bring it in unreal engine. And why not, I made it Drivable!. And ya I brought it to Unity too and drove there too. I am more comfortable with Unity Btw.
