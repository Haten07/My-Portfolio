        This all started when I was learning photoshop. The first thing I did was made the main character. 
        I had a nice story in my mind so I started creating Levels.
        Then I started animated walk cycle and the nice fire of the fire guy in Adobe Animate. And then It came to Unity.
        When I was making Levels in Unity I realised, that I need modular/tilable sprites to make my levels seamlessly so I made this

        I first sketched my levels and then made it in photoshop, which I think was pretty Interesting Levels.

        Things took a different turn When I got it in Unity. My Idea to make many levels was droped. And my final plan was to make only three maps. 
        I used sprite shape 2D to make my whole level, that made the process a lot faster. It was my unity learning phase so I included many types of Inbuilt properties of Unity.
